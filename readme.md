## Description

This project [Shopify Home Page](https://shopify-home.netlify.app/) was built using Semantic HTML and **Tailwind** from scratch. It took me almost 10 hours to make **Shopify** Home page clone. This is one of those websites which test your learning and writing the code which is efficient. **Tailwind** is a utility-first CSS framework in which we can directly write classes in the markup. This project helped me a lot in understanding the basic yet effective Tailwind concepts. This project hepled me understanding concepts like grid, animation & transistion in Tailwind css. The main learning after building this project is to make complex responsive design simpler and easier and faster with **Tailwindcss** screen breakpoints. Also a great credit to [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/in) developers as I learnt best use case scenarios of Tailwind. The Project was completed under guidance of [Hitesh Choudhary](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary), CTO Ineuron
